## Initial guidelines
- It is recommended to reproduce the results guided by the numbering of the R scripts;
- The scripts are in a logical sequence. Therefore, it is recommended to follow step by step.
- Remember to change all directories in the scripts to where they are saved. This will avoid bugs in R;
  - It is critical that the necessary R packages/libraries are installed and loaded. They are indicated in each script.

## Organization of the scripts and results repository

**1 - Leitura de dados e imputacao da escolaridade.R**  (Read the SIM adult mortality database in the year 2010 and perform the process of imputing the education variable); <br />
**2 - Criar tabelas auxiliares para cálculo das medidas utilizadas.R** (Calculates the summary measures, variance matrix and covariance of multiple imputation and confidence intervals);<br />
**3 - Medida de exposicao.R** (calculates the exposure measure used in the denominator of mortality rates);<br />
**4 - Tabelas de sobrevivência (Com correcao de sub registro).R**

 *Note: This script contains the main results of the work and includes:*<br />
